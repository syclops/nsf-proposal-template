\section*{Project Summary}
% Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than one
% page in length. The Project Summary consists of an overview, a statement on
% the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement on the
% broader impacts of the proposed activity.

% The Project Summary should be informative to other persons working in the same
% or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a broad
% audience within the scientific domain. It should not be an abstract of the
% proposal.

\subsection*{Overview}
% The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the
% proposal were funded and a statement of objectives and methods to be employed.

\subsection*{Intellectual Merit}
% The statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the
% proposed activity to advance knowledge.

\subsection*{Broader Impacts}
% The statement on broader impacts should describe the potential of the proposed
% activity to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific,
% desired societal outcomes.
