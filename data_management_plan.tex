\section*{Data Management Plan}

% This supplementary document should describe how the proposal will conform to
% NSF policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results (see Chapter
% XI.D.4).

% Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than
% incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples,
% physical collections, and other supporting materials created or gathered in
% the course of work under NSF awards. Recipients are expected to encourage and
% facilitate such sharing. Privileged or confidential information should be
% released only in a form that protects the privacy of individuals and subjects
% involved.

% NSF normally allows recipients to retain principal legal rights to
% intellectual property developed under NSF awards to provide incentives for
% development and dissemination of inventions, software and publications that
% can enhance their usefulness, accessibility, and upkeep. Such incentives do
% not, however, reduce the responsibility that investigators and organizations
% have as members of the scientific and engineering community, to make results,
% data, and collections available to other researchers.

\paragraph{Data Generated}
% What types of data, samples, physical collections, software, curriculum
% materials, and other materials will be produced in the course of the project?

\paragraph{Standards for Data and Metadata}
% What standards will be used for data and metadata format and content? Where
% existing standards are absent or deemed inadequate, this should be documented
% along with any proposed solutions or remedies.

\paragraph{Access and Sharing Policies}
% What policies will be used for access and sharing, including provisions for
% appropriate protection of privacy, confidentiality, security, intellectual
% property, or other rights or requirements?

\paragraph{Reuse, Redistribution, and Derivatives}
% What policies and provisions govern re-use, re-distribution, and the
% production of derivatives?

\paragraph{Archival Plan for Data and Materials}
% What plans are there for archiving data, samples, and other research products,
% and for preservation of access to them?
