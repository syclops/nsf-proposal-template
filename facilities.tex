\section*{Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources}
% This section of the proposal is used to assess the adequacy of the resources
% available to perform the effort proposed to satisfy both the Intellectual
% Merit and Broader Impacts review criteria. Proposers should describe only
% those resources that are directly applicable. Proposers should include an
% aggregated description of the internal and external resources (both physical
% and personnel) that the organization and its collaborators, and subawardees
% will provide to the project, should it be funded. Such information must be
% provided in this section, in lieu of other parts of the proposal (e.g., Budget
% Justification, Project Description). The description should be narrative in
% nature and must not include any quantifiable financial information. Reviewers
% will evaluate the information during the merit review process and the
% cognizant NSF Program Officer will review it for programmatic and technical
% sufficiency.

% The following is only a suggestion of what topics might be included.
\paragraph{Physical Space and Resources}

\paragraph{Computing Hardware}

\paragraph{Computing Software}

\paragraph{Other Resources}
